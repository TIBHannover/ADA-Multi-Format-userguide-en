## Description

The pipeline is about automation of publishing and connects the word processor to directly publish using single source publishing technology and methods.

Single Source Publishing: Edit in one place and distribute as multi-format to different locations automatically to produce professional publication-ready-outputs.

The pipeline connects [Fidus Writer](https://www.fiduswriter.org/) an online word processor with GitLab or GitHub for versioned storage and uses [Vivliosyle](https://vivliostyle.org/) for CSS Typesetting. The pipeline project is based on open source work of [ADA Semantic Publishing Pipeline](https://github.com/TIBHannover/ADA) at the Open Science Lab, TIB (Hannover).

All software used with the exception of GitHub is open source.
