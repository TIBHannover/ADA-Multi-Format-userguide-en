    <div class="article-part article-richtext article-body">
      <p>The book project in Fidus Writer will act as an empty container for your publication, later on you can change all the file names and book information to reflect your books title and content. You can also add and remove documents at any time.</p>
      <h2 id="H4535132">What's covered here</h2>
      <ol id="L84796311">
        <li>
          <p>Create a 'personal' folder (only you see this - it's not shared) for your book documents.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make three placeholder documents for your book parts: Front matter; Section 1, and; Back matter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add your documents to a Fidus Writer Book - a collation of book documents.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Connecting your book to a Git repo.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In a later step, sharing the publication with your team will be covered.</p>
      <p>Complete publication configuration details can be found in the pipeline manual.</p>
      <h2 id="H4439255">1. Create a 'personal' folder</h2>
      <p>Here you will create a folder and after this create your three documents in the folder. To start with you need to be in the Document area of the website. </p>
      <p>At the top of the page in the secondary menu, click on 'Create New Folder' and give the folder a name.</p>
      <figure id="F89073221" class="aligned-center image-width-100" data-aligned="center" data-width="100" data-category="photo"><img src="images/8c499ef1-2708-4cab-a7c0-7b428719cf92.png">
        <figcaption><span class="label-counter" data-book-counter="13" data-chapter-counter="1">Photo</span><span class="text">Document folder creation - add folder, name, and save</span></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now you will have an empty folder. If no documents are made in the folder, and it is left empty the folder will not be saved when you navigate away.</p>
      <h2 id="H8214025">2. Create placeholder documents </h2>
      <p>We will now create three documents in the folder you have just created. These are the placeholder document examples you will make:</p>
      <ul id="L53525721">
        <li>
          <p>Front Matter: Where you will add imprint, contributor information, acknowledgements, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Section 1: A top level part of a book as section or chapter</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Back Matter: This can contain appendices, glossaries, or abbreviations, etc.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="H7006285">How to create documents</h3>
      <p>In the sub-menu below Documents select 'Create new document' and choose <strong>'Book Default'</strong> document template. If you are working on a special book or publication series you might use a different document template. Consult the publication manager for guidance.</p>
      <p>Here you will add three documents as placeholders. These are added, so you can configure your book basics, names and documents can be changed or deleted later. Make three documents with these name: Front Matter; Section 1, and; Back Matter.</p>

      <p>You need to have created your Git repo in advance which is covered in Step 1., of the guide, this will repo will be where you output your publication files too.</p>
      <p>First we will connect Fidus Writer with the Git instance you are using, this is done by authorizing Git to connect with Fidus Writer using you user accounts on both systems.</p>
      <h3 id="H5660938">Connect platforms</h3>
