Navigate to the book site area and locate your book.


The to the right of your book click on the pencil icon and this will open up the 'sharing dialogue box.


On the left are you contacts. If you do not have any contact your will need to add them below using the add contacts icon. This will open a second dialogue box - here you will be able to invite people either via user name or email address. Once you add them you can close the dialogue box.


The users will receive an email inviting them to the project, they will also receive a notice on screen if they are logged into Fidus Writer.


Then you will need to move the users from the left to right column and give them the apppropriate access rights. For your contributors this will be as authors - make sure that the users have the pencil icon next to their name and not the eye icon, which is for viewing only.


You have now completed the process of granting users access to your publication project.
