\title{Step 4: Publish as Multiâ€‘format!}

\maketitle


What is covered in the quick start guide for multi-format publishing.


For users of the system you will only need to select your layout design style from the available library of style and click output.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First the system can create many outputs from one source as 'Publication Ready Outputs' (PROs)\protect\footnotemark{}, as well as output additional interoperable and machine readable formats. 


\item The system can apply pre-made reusable templates of \textbf{'layout design styles'} with automate machine typesetting.


\item Save out styled output formats to Git at the push of a button, or preview the outputs direct from the system. Note the PDF format needs to be saved locally and then uploaded to Git (this will be automated in the near future, Sept 2022).


\end{enumerate}\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}\stepcounter{footnote}
\footnotetext{A Publication Ready Output (PRO) means that the format is ready for professional publishing, including typesetting, metadata, and other formatting and settings. Many systems can save files in a format, for example as HTML, or PDF - but it does not mean it can be used professionally. Microsoft Word can save as HTML or PDF but it doesn't make the formatted files into finished publications ready for distribution.}

4. A Git dialogue will now appear called 'Commit message'. This is a note about the export you will make to Git and it will appear in the file listing for this git export. The pupose of the note is to inform other team members or Git users about your export, for example what kind of updates were made. A Commit message should be informative and you can pick your own style, noting these may be public if the Gitrepo is public.   


Click save and the export will start. The system will give you updates on the progress bottom right.
