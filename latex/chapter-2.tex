\title{What You'll Need to Get Started}

\maketitle


Below are instructions for the steps you'll need to complete before starting work on a 'publishing pipeline' project.


\textbf{All users will need an email address that can receive emails with URL links that can be used for account verification on the web.}


The content below has been ordered by user types:

\begin{itemize}
\item Publication contributor


\item Publication manager


\end{itemize}

\textbf{Account creation:} The instructions below cover default account creation methods. If the listed platforms are using 'Single Sign On' features then authentication can also be made though organization login credentials or platform accounts such GitLab, OAuth services, or using other authentication and authorization infrastructure (AAI)s


\subsection{Publication contributor}\label{H8481455}



\subsubsection{Account creation}\label{H3214765}



\subsubsection{Fidus Writer}\label{H8748576}



Fidus Writer has three account creation processes and depending on the specific instance you're using you will have different options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invite only


\item Sign Up


\item Single Sign On authentication


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Invite only:} If there is no 'Sign-up' button on website then account creation is through invite only. Please contact the site managers and request an account. If you are approved for an account you will receive an email with instructions for completing the account creation process.


\textbf{Sign Up:} Follow the account creation instructions on the website. Once you have filled in the detail you will receive an email to complete the sign-up process.


\emph{Important note: You must verify your account my clicking on the email received in your email inbox and agreeing to the privacy policy to complete the account creation process. If this is not completed your account cannot be created.}


\textbf{Single Sign On:} Fidus Writer can be used with authentication credentials from other platforms that use the OAuth protocol. If you have an account with an authentication service listed on the Fidus Writer instance your using you will be able to log in using that account, whether it is your workplace account or another platform account, for example using a GitLab account.  


You will be able to see if other platform logins can be used as they will be listed on the Fidus Writer homepage. Below is an example site that uses GitHub and GitLab.

\subsubsection{Git}\label{H4652413}



Depending on what Git platform you are using in the 'publishing platform' you will need an account on each one. You may be using more than one Git platform and in that case you will need an account on each individual platform.


Currently: GitLab CE, GitLab.com, and GitHub.com are supported (2022).
